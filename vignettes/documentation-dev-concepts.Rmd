## Github-actions workflow for shinyapps.io

The aim is to stup a configuration that customizes Github actions in a way that
allows to deploy the shiny App to shinyapps.io automatically. Specifically:

1. The main branch reflects the App in production state
2. Any PR reflects various tests i.e. different dev-states of the App
3. Once a PR gets merged into main, the production App is updates with the 
PR-feature and automatically re-deployed
4. The testing/dev-App versions are also automatically deployed to hidden links
5. Eventually, a testing workflow a-la cypress can be employed onto the 
different test/dev-App versions
