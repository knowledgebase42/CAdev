# CAdev

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of `CAdev` is to summarize some development concepts for shiny Apps in
production settings. This includes the setup of a GitHub-actions workflow for
production/development branches and remote hosting using `shinyapps.io`, an
authentication client setup and other things.

The summary is equipped with a golem hook setup, to ease the startup of new 
projects and quick prototyping for clients of Cologne analytics.

## Installation

You can install the development version of CAdev from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ilyaZar/CAdev")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(CAdev)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
