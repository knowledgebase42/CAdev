# CAdev

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of `{CAdev}` is to summarize some development concepts for shiny Apps in
production settings. This includes the setup of a GitHub-actions workflow for
production/development branches and remote hosting using `shinyapps.io`, an
authentication client setup and other things.

The summary is equipped with a `{golem}` hook setup, to ease the startup of new 
projects and quick prototyping for clients of Cologne analytics.

## Installation

You can install the development version of `{CAdev}` from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ilyaZar/CAdev")
```
