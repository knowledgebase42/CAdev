# CAdev

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of `{CAdev}` is to summarize some development concepts for
shiny Apps in production settings. This includes the setup of a
GitHub-actions workflow for production/development branches and remote
hosting using `shinyapps.io`, an authentication client setup and other
things.

The summary is equipped with a `{golem}` hook setup, to ease the startup
of new projects and quick prototyping for clients of Cologne analytics.

## Installation

You can install the development version of `{CAdev}` from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
